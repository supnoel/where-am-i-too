# EFT: Where Am I Too

A personally modified version of the Tarkov companion tool "Where Am I".

This version improves upon the original Where Am I by fixing bugs and enhancing utility features.
Those who have used it may notice that some features from TarkovHelper have been partially implemented.

## Differences from Where Am I

### Fixed the frequent vertical position misalignment bug

This was the biggest bug in the original Where Am I.
This bug was actually the reason I decided to modify it for my own use.
It has now been completely fixed.

### Auto map switch on raid start

Automatically detects raid start and switches to the corresponding map.
This option requires the log folder path to be set.
If auto log folder detection doesn't work, please try restarting the game.

### Auto Panning

When the location marker reaches the edge (deadzone) of the viewport, the map automatically scrolls to keep the marker visible on screen. The deadzone percentage can be adjusted in settings.
It can be set from 50% to 99% — closer to 50% means panning centers the marker more, while closer to 99% allows the marker to stay near the edge.

#### At 50%

### Floor switching with Ctrl + NumPad in-game

You can switch floors directly in-game using Ctrl + NumPad combinations.
This feature was inspired by Tarkov Helper.
It only works while the game is the active window.

### Auto save & auto restore quests

Right-click a quest to select it and it will be saved automatically. Right-click again to deselect and the saved entry will be removed.
When you switch maps and return, your quests are automatically restored.
Since it uses the tarkov-market page as-is, free users can save up to 3 quests, while paid users can save unlimited quests.

### Save & restore panel hidden state

Saves the state of the tarkov-market panel. When you switch maps and return, the panel state is restored.

    The contents inside the panel (boss, sniper scav, cultist, etc.) are not saved yet — planned for a future update.

### Auto Screenshot Cleanup

Automatically detects raid end and cleans up screenshot files.
If you need to preserve your screenshots, please uncheck this option.

### First Launch

On first launch, the tool automatically detects your EFT screenshot and log folder paths. If the detected paths are incorrect, you can change them manually in Settings or use the `Auto Find` button.

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

Choose a map from the top-left dropdown. If Auto Map Detection is enabled, the map switches automatically when you enter a raid.
